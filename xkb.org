* setxkbmap

setxkbmap generates high-level keyboard map description and feeds it
to map compiler (xkbcomp) which compiles it into .xkm file and
installs into X.

# With -print, print keymap description. Keymap components are taken
# from current system settings.
setxkbmap -print
#=> xkb_keymap {
#=> 	xkb_keycodes  { include "evdev+aliases(qwerty)"	};
#=> 	xkb_types     { include "complete"	};
#=> 	xkb_compat    { include "complete"	};
#=> 	xkb_symbols   { include "pc+us(dvorak)+us:2+inet(evdev)"	};
#=> 	xkb_geometry  { include "pc(pc105)"	};
#=> };

* xev

xev can be used to get keycodes. It creates a separate window and logs
specified events that happen to it.

xev -event keyboard
#=> KeyPress event, serial 28, synthetic NO, window 0x3e00001,
#=>     state 0x10, keycode 105 (keysym 0xffe4, Control_R), same_screen YES,

* xkbcomp

xkbcomp $DISPLAY current.xkb # store current keymap description
