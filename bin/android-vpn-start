#
# Policy based routing (PBR)
#
# By default, routes are looked up from table "main" based on packet destination. PBR makes routing decisions based on rules instead, e.g. on android:
#
# ```sh
# ip rule
# 0:      from all lookup local
# 10000:  from all fwmark 0xc0000/0xd0000 lookup legacy_system
# 10500:  from all oif wlan0 uidrange 0-0 lookup wlan0
# 11110:  from all iif rndis0 lookup tun0
# 11111:  from all to 192.168.44.0/24 iif tun0 lookup tun0
# 13000:  from all fwmark 0x10063/0x1ffff lookup local_network
# 13000:  from all fwmark 0x1006d/0x1ffff lookup wlan0
# 14000:  from all oif wlan0 lookup wlan0
# 15000:  from all fwmark 0x0/0x10000 lookup legacy_system
# 16000:  from all fwmark 0x0/0x10000 lookup legacy_network
# 17000:  from all fwmark 0x0/0x10000 lookup local_network
# 19000:  from all fwmark 0x6d/0x1ffff lookup wlan0
# 22000:  from all fwmark 0x0/0xffff lookup wlan0
# 23000:  from all fwmark 0x0/0xffff uidrange 0-0 lookup main
# 32000:  from all unreachable
# ```
#
# Each rule has priority (also called pref). 0 is the highest pref. Each rule has predicate (conditions to match) and action:
#
# - from - ip source prefix (`all` means don't care)
#
# - to - ip dest prefix, e.g. 192.168.44.0/24 from rule 11111 above
#
# - iif - incoming iface
#
# - oif - generally outgoing iface is not known - routing decides it, so this is only for outgoing sockets bound to specific iface
#
# - fwmark/mask - this is for matching packets marked with MARK target in netfilter [mangle table](https://www.frozentux.net/iptables-tutorial/chunkyhtml/index.html). Packet's mark is first xor'ed with fwmark and then and'ed with mask to get final value. If that value is zero, packet matches (see https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/436799/how-the-fwmark-works-together-with-mask-in-ip-rule-command). The mask specifies what bits of fwmark must match, i.e. are important. Both fwmark and mask are 32-bit values. E.g. on android with vpn turned on, all packets coming from vpn tunnel are marked with 0x300a6 mark by `iptables -t mangle -A INPUT -i tun0 -j MARK --set-mark 0x300a6` rule and then filtered with 0x100a6/0x1ffff fwmark/mask to lookup routes in tun0 table.
#
# - lookup <table> action - assuming predicate match, go to table for routing decision. If routing decision is made there, rule processing stops. Otherwise, next rule is checked and so on.
#
# E.g. rules 11110 and 11111 were added with:
#
# ```sh
#  # route packets coming from iface rndis0 using table tun0
#  ip rule add iif rndis0 pref 11110 lookup tun0
#
#  # route packets coming back from vpn tunnel iface tun0 to
#  # subnet 192.168.44.0/24 using table tun0
#  ip rule add iif tun0 to 192.168.44.0/24 pref 11111 lookup tun0
# ```
#
# To remove a rule it's enough to filter by pref:
#
# ip rule del pref 11111
