# Chroot creation for x86_64 Arch Linux goes as follows (taken from
# https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Install_Arch_Linux_from_existing_Linux):
#
# - Mount livecd iso image and 'sudo unsquashfs
# <mountpoint>/arch/x86_64/airootfs.sfs' from it somewhere. This is
# method B from link above, livecd has an almost ready to use system.
#
# - Unlike the script in the link, just use arch-chroot from unpacked
# squashfs 'sudo <squashfs-root>/bin/arch-chroot <squashfs-root>'. We
# end up using modified arch-chroot though (see below).
#
# - Setup keyring: pacman-key --init && pacman-key --populate
# archlinux
#
# - Generate locales: locale-gen
#
# - GIDs between alpine and arch differ pretty much. To provide arch
# with access to alpine host alsa, create an arch group 'alpine-audio'
# with gid 18 (same as 'audio' group in alpine): groupadd -g 18
# alpine-audio
#
# - Create user: useradd -G wheel,alpine-audio <user>

# Run our custom arch-chroot (which see), which does additional mounts
# or does them differently from distro's one.
sudo arch-chroot "$@"
